# Eval data for product-manager

Static fixture for deterministic evals.

Scenario: LaunchPad Lite is a user-facing SaaS MVP that helps indie founders publish a simple product-launch page and collect signups.

Existing product context:
- Core value: help founders validate demand quickly with a clean launch page and signup funnel.
- Primary critical user journey: create launch page → publish → share link → collect signups.
- Feedback sources available: in-app feedback link, support email, Telegram beta group, GitHub issues, and short post-signup survey.
- Current analytics are incomplete: page views and signup counts exist, but publish-state confusion, signup-form errors, activation, and retention are not instrumented yet.
- Current raw feedback examples:
  - One user asks for "AI-generated animated backgrounds".
  - Five beta users say they cannot tell whether their page is published or still draft.
  - Two users report the signup form returns a 500 error.
  - One user asks for a full CRM.

A good product-manager response should define the PRD artifact, add a daily feedback review loop, define product metrics tied to the primary critical user journey, route signup 500 reports as bugs, identify the repeated publish/draft confusion as a core-value aligned product problem, and avoid acting on one-off feature requests like animated backgrounds or a full CRM unless later evidence shows a repeated core problem. It should include activation/funnel metrics such as create page → publish → share link → signup, identify missing analytics instrumentation as follow-up work, name where metrics will be reviewed, and specify what regression or drop-off should trigger product work.
