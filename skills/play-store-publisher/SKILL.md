# Play Store Publisher

## Overview

Own the operational path from a release-ready Android build to a published Google Play testing or production track using the Google Play Console UI. This skill is for the human/account-bound parts of Play publishing: console setup, app creation, app signing declarations, tester lists, AAB upload, release notes, review/rollout screens, policy setup gates, and confirming the opt-in or store link.

Use build/development skills for creating the app binary; use this skill when the task moves into Play Console. The console is account-bound and may require login, payment, organization verification, 2FA, policy declarations, or permissions that NED cannot bypass.

## When to Use

Use this skill when:

- A user asks to upload or publish an Android app to Google Play.
- A release-ready `.aab` exists and needs to be uploaded through Play Console UI.
- EAS Submit, fastlane, or API upload is blocked by missing Google Play service account JSON or permissions.
- A Play Console app, testing track, tester list, or production rollout needs to be created or checked.
- Browser automation is being used against `play.google.com/console`.
- Internal, closed, open, or production testing setup is blocking launch.

Do not use this skill for writing the app code, fixing Android build failures, writing store listing copy, or planning ad/user acquisition except to hand off blockers to `android-app-dev`, `react-native-app-dev`, `marketer`, `devops`, `qa`, or `product-manager`.

## Required Inputs

Before touching Play Console, collect or derive:

- Google Play Console developer account access and the selected developer account.
- App name, default language, app/game choice, free/paid choice, and package/application ID.
- Final Android package ID. Treat package ID changes as irreversible once uploaded to Play.
- Release artifact path or URL: `.aab`, not `.apk`, for Play Store release tracks.
- Version name and `versionCode`.
- Build provenance: commit/PR, CI/EAS/Gradle build ID, and artifact checksum when practical.
- Target track: internal testing, closed testing, open testing, or production.
- Tester list name and tester emails for internal/closed testing.
- Release notes, localized if needed. Minimal valid notes can be:
  ```text
  <en-US>
  Initial release.
  </en-US>
  ```
- Store listing assets/status: app icon, feature graphic, screenshots, short/full descriptions, category, contact email, privacy policy URL.
- Play policy setup status: Data safety, content rating, target audience, ads declaration, app access/demo credentials, government apps/news/health/financial declarations when relevant.
- Whether automated submission is expected. If yes, confirm Google Play service account JSON and Play Console API access; otherwise use UI.

## Release-Readiness Gate

Do not start uploading random artifacts. First verify:

1. **Package ID is final.** For example, a project-branded ID such as `app.datanav.news` is preferable to stale scaffolding like `com.example.*` or a previous working title. If wrong, stop and rebuild before upload.
2. **VersionCode increments.** Play rejects reused version codes after an upload to the package.
3. **AAB is release-signed.** Expo/EAS production profiles or Gradle release builds should use the intended signing key and Play App Signing expectations.
4. **Artifact opens structurally.** At minimum, inspect it as a zip and confirm `base/manifest/AndroidManifest.xml` exists.
5. **Local sanity checks passed.** Run the repo's typecheck/tests/export/build checks or link to CI.
6. **Privacy/policy claims are truthful.** Do not guess Data safety, ads, location, account deletion, or content rating answers.
7. **Testing track has testers.** Internal testing release publication is not useful until at least one tester list is saved and selected.

## Google Play Console UI Workflow

### 1. Open the correct console and account

- Navigate to `https://play.google.com/console`.
- Select the correct developer account if multiple accounts are visible.
- If the account is not verified, payment/identity/organization verification may block app creation or publication. Report the blocker and ask the user to complete account-bound steps.

### 2. Create the app

From **All apps**:

1. Click **Create app**.
2. Fill:
   - App name.
   - Default language.
   - App or game.
   - Free or paid.
3. Accept required declarations only if they are true and the user/project agrees:
   - Developer Program Policies.
   - Play App Signing Terms.
   - US export laws.
4. Create the app and record:
   - App name.
   - Package name once associated.
   - Play Console app URL/app ID if visible.

### 3. Prefer internal testing first

For first release, use **Test and release → Testing → Internal testing** unless the user explicitly requests another track.

Internal testing is best for confirming install flow, Play App Signing, package name, opt-in link, and review blockers without a public launch. It supports up to 100 joined internal testers; more can be listed, but only the first 100 to join count.

### 4. Create or select testers before final rollout

On **Internal testing → Testers**:

1. Click **Create email list** or select an existing list.
2. Use a clear name such as `Internal testers`.
3. Add tester emails; press **Enter** after typing each email so it appears in the added-email table.
4. Click **Save changes** in the dialog.
5. Back on the Testers tab, ensure the list is selected.
6. Click the main **Save** button.
7. Verify the page no longer says the release will be unavailable because no testers are specified.

Known UI pitfall: Play Console can show an enabled **Save changes** button but browser automation clicks may not actuate it. If this happens, use a visible Chrome/CDP session, refresh once, reopen the dialog, press Enter after the email, and use a real mouse/keyboard if needed. Do not claim testers were saved unless the dialog closes and the Testers tab reflects the saved list after refresh.

### 5. Create the release and upload AAB

On **Internal testing → Releases**:

1. Click **Create new release**.
2. Confirm Play App Signing setup/declarations if prompted.
3. Upload the `.aab` using the file picker/drop zone.
4. Wait for Play to process/optimize the bundle.
5. Confirm the processed bundle shows the expected:
   - Package ID.
   - Version name.
   - Version code.
   - Install/download size.
6. Add release notes.
7. Save the draft.

If Google flags missing deobfuscation or native debug symbols, classify it correctly:

- Missing deobfuscation file is usually non-blocking for a first/minified-off release but should become a follow-up for crash readability if R8/ProGuard/minification is enabled.
- Package name, signing, version code reuse, policy, or target SDK failures are blockers.

### 6. Preview, confirm, and publish/roll out

1. Open the draft release.
2. Click **Preview and confirm the release**.
3. Read warnings. Do not blindly ignore:
   - **No testers specified** blocks useful internal testing; fix Testers first.
   - Policy/data-safety/content-rating/app-access warnings may block review or production.
4. Click **Save and publish**, **Start rollout**, or the current track's equivalent final button.
5. If a confirmation dialog appears, confirm only when the track, artifact, package, and testers are correct.
6. Verify final state:
   - Internal testing status is active/in review as shown by Play.
   - Opt-in link is present and copyable.
   - Release appears under the intended track.

### 7. Record a publishing report

Add or update a project-local runbook/status file, for example:

- `.projects/<project>/runbooks/google-play-release-prep.md`
- `.projects/<project>/release/google-play-publishing-log.md`

Use this report shape:

```text
Google Play publishing report — <project> — <date/time + timezone>
- App name:
- Package ID:
- Developer account:
- Track:
- Release/versionCode:
- Artifact path/URL/checksum:
- Build source commit/PR:
- Store listing status:
- Policy setup status:
- Tester list / opt-in link:
- Actions completed:
- Current Play status:
- Blockers:
- Follow-up issues:
- Evidence: <URLs, screenshots, console text, build logs>
```

## EAS / Expo Notes

For Expo projects:

- Build a production Play artifact with a production AAB profile, commonly:
  ```bash
  npx eas-cli build -p android --profile production
  ```
- Submit can be automated only after Google Play service account JSON and API access are configured:
  ```bash
  npx eas-cli submit -p android --profile production --latest --non-interactive
  ```
- If submit fails because no service account JSON is configured, fall back to the UI workflow and report that future automation needs service-account setup.
- Keep `android.package` and `android.versionCode` in `app.json` / `app.config.*` final before the first upload.
- Download the final AAB artifact locally when using UI upload and preserve its path in the publishing log.

## Browser Automation Guidance

Play Console is a complex web app. Use these habits:

- Prefer the user's visible, logged-in Chrome via CDP when account session matters.
- Use snapshots/vision to verify the actual screen text after each major click.
- For file uploads, use CDP `DOM.setFileInputFiles` on the actual file input when drag/drop is unreliable.
- Wait for AAB processing to finish before entering final release notes or navigating away.
- After clicking save/publish buttons, verify state by reloading or reading the page text; do not trust the click.
- If accessibility refs disappear or only “Loading Google Play Console” appears, wait/refresh and inspect `document.body.innerText` through CDP.
- If UI actions stall repeatedly, produce exact manual steps rather than burning tool loops.

## Handoffs

- `android-app-dev` / `react-native-app-dev`: build failures, package ID fixes, versionCode changes, signing config, AAB generation.
- `play-store-cli`: service account setup, fastlane supply/EAS Submit/Gradle Play Publisher, CLI/API validation, CI release automation.
- `devops`: CI release build, secrets/service-account storage, monitoring, and broader deployment operations.
- `marketer`: store listing copy, screenshots positioning, launch/ad plan, country localization, Google App Campaigns.
- `product-manager`: target audience, pricing/free-vs-paid, launch readiness, app access requirements, success metrics.
- `qa`: install testing, smoke tests, opt-in link verification, device compatibility, regression checks.

## Common Pitfalls

1. **Uploading with the wrong package ID.** Once Play accepts a package, you cannot rename it for that app. Stop and rebuild if the ID is stale.
2. **Confusing APK and AAB.** Play release tracks need Android App Bundles for normal publishing; APKs are only for direct sideload/internal sharing contexts.
3. **Skipping tester setup.** Internal testing can have a valid draft release but still be unavailable because no tester list is saved/selected.
4. **Trusting an enabled button.** Play Console may show enabled Save buttons that automation cannot actuate. Verify persistence after refresh.
5. **Guessing policy declarations.** Data safety, ads, app access, and content rating must reflect the app. If unknown, create a blocker.
6. **Reusing versionCode.** Every uploaded release for a package must have a new integer versionCode.
7. **Claiming publication too early.** “AAB uploaded” is not “published.” “Release draft saved” is not “rolled out.” State the exact Play status.
8. **Ignoring account permissions.** Missing permission text such as “You need permission to edit testing releases” is an account/admin blocker, not a code bug.
