# Play Store CLI

## Overview

Automate Google Play publishing with CLI/API tools so NED does not have to fight the Play Console UI for repeat releases. Prefer CLI automation after the one-time Play Console/account setup exists: Play Console developer account, app record/package, Google Play Developer API access, service account, and appropriate app permissions.

This skill covers fastlane `supply` / `upload_to_play_store`, Expo EAS Submit, Gradle Play Publisher, and direct Google Play Developer API checks. It does **not** bypass Google account verification, payment, 2FA, policy declarations, app creation gaps, or missing permissions.

## When to Use

Use this skill when:

- A user asks for Play Store Console access via CLI/API.
- Play Console UI automation is flaky and repeatable CLI publishing is safer.
- A project needs `fastlane supply`, EAS Submit, Gradle Play Publisher, or Google Play Developer API configured.
- The team needs CI to upload AABs, promote tracks, stage rollouts, or manage Play listing metadata.
- A Google Play service account JSON exists or the user can create one.
- A previous release was uploaded manually and future releases should be automated.

Do not use this skill to create a brand-new Google Play developer account, pay fees, complete identity verification, answer policy declarations without product facts, or create final store listing copy. Hand those to the user, `play-store-publisher`, `product-manager`, or `marketer` as appropriate.

## Key Reality Check

CLI tools usually require one-time console setup first:

1. Google Play developer account exists and is verified.
2. App record exists in Play Console for the intended package name.
3. Google Play Developer API is enabled/linked for the Play account.
4. A Google Cloud service account exists.
5. The service account is invited in Play Console with app-level permissions.
6. The repo/CI has the service account JSON stored as a secret, not committed.

If any of these are missing, guide the user through the smallest one-time setup and then continue via CLI.

## Tool Choice

Prefer tools in this order:

1. **EAS Submit** for Expo apps already using EAS builds.
2. **fastlane supply** for general React Native, native Android, CI, metadata, track promotion, and repeatable release lanes.
3. **Gradle Play Publisher** for native Android/Gradle teams that want Play publishing embedded in Gradle tasks.
4. **Direct Google Play Developer API** only for custom checks/scripts when fastlane/GPP/EAS do not cover the need.

Use `play-store-publisher` for first-time app creation or UI-only blockers; use this skill for repeatable release automation.

## Service Account Setup

### User-facing setup request

Give this concise instruction instead of asking for passwords or raw Google credentials in chat:

```text
I can automate Google Play releases from CLI if you create a Play Console service account.

Please do this once:
1. Open Play Console → Setup → API access.
2. Link/select the Google Cloud project for this Play account.
3. Create or choose a service account.
4. Create a JSON key for that service account.
5. In Play Console → Users and permissions, invite/grant the service account access to this app.
6. Grant only the needed app permissions: view app information, view financial data only if needed, manage store presence if metadata uploads are needed, and manage releases for testing/production tracks that NED should publish to.
7. Store the JSON as a local file outside git or as a CI secret named `GOOGLE_PLAY_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_JSON`.
8. Tell me the package name and which tracks I may publish to: internal, closed, open, or production.
```

For local work, prefer a path such as:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.config/noegodev/google-play
chmod 700 ~/.config/noegodev ~/.config/noegodev/google-play
# Save key as: ~/.config/noegodev/google-play/<project>-play-service-account.json
chmod 600 ~/.config/noegodev/google-play/<project>-play-service-account.json
```

Never commit the JSON key. Add/verify ignores:

```gitignore
*.json
!package.json
!app.json
!google-services.json
fastlane/play-store-credentials.json
.google-play/
```

If the repo genuinely needs `google-services.json` for Firebase, do not blanket-ignore it without checking existing conventions.

## Verify Access Before Publishing

For fastlane:

```bash
bundle exec fastlane run validate_play_store_json_key \
  json_key:/absolute/path/to/play-service-account.json
```

Also run a harmless read when possible:

```bash
bundle exec fastlane supply \
  --json_key /absolute/path/to/play-service-account.json \
  --package_name app.example.app \
  --track internal \
  --skip_upload_apk true \
  --skip_upload_aab true \
  --skip_upload_metadata true \
  --skip_upload_images true \
  --skip_upload_screenshots true
```

If this fails with permission errors, fix Play Console **Users and permissions** for the service account. If it fails with package/app not found, confirm the app record and package name in Play Console.

## fastlane supply Setup

### Install fastlane safely

Prefer a Gemfile so CI and local runs use the same version:

```bash
bundle init
bundle add fastlane
bundle exec fastlane --version
```

For existing projects, preserve the existing Gemfile and lockfile.

### Minimal Appfile

Create `fastlane/Appfile` without secrets:

```ruby
json_key_file(ENV.fetch("GOOGLE_PLAY_JSON_KEY_FILE"))
package_name(ENV.fetch("ANDROID_PACKAGE_NAME"))
```

Local shell example:

```bash
export GOOGLE_PLAY_JSON_KEY_FILE="$HOME/.config/noegodev/google-play/myapp-play-service-account.json"
export ANDROID_PACKAGE_NAME="app.example.app"
```

### Minimal Fastfile lanes

Create `fastlane/Fastfile`:

```ruby
def play_json_key_file
  ENV.fetch("GOOGLE_PLAY_JSON_KEY_FILE")
end

def android_package_name
  ENV.fetch("ANDROID_PACKAGE_NAME")
end

platform :android do
  desc "Validate Google Play API access without publishing"
  lane :play_validate do
    validate_play_store_json_key(json_key: play_json_key_file)
  end

  desc "Upload an AAB to internal testing as a draft"
  lane :play_internal_draft do |options|
    upload_to_play_store(
      json_key: play_json_key_file,
      package_name: android_package_name,
      aab: options[:aab] || ENV.fetch("ANDROID_AAB_PATH"),
      track: "internal",
      release_status: "draft",
      skip_upload_metadata: true,
      skip_upload_images: true,
      skip_upload_screenshots: true
    )
  end

  desc "Upload an AAB to internal testing and complete rollout"
  lane :play_internal do |options|
    upload_to_play_store(
      json_key: play_json_key_file,
      package_name: android_package_name,
      aab: options[:aab] || ENV.fetch("ANDROID_AAB_PATH"),
      track: "internal",
      release_status: "completed",
      skip_upload_metadata: true,
      skip_upload_images: true,
      skip_upload_screenshots: true
    )
  end

  desc "Promote a tested release to production staged rollout"
  lane :play_promote_production do |options|
    upload_to_play_store(
      json_key: play_json_key_file,
      package_name: android_package_name,
      track: options[:from] || "internal",
      track_promote_to: "production",
      release_status: "inProgress",
      rollout: options[:rollout] || "0.1",
      skip_upload_metadata: true,
      skip_upload_images: true,
      skip_upload_screenshots: true
    )
  end
end
```

Run lanes:

```bash
bundle exec fastlane android play_validate
bundle exec fastlane android play_internal_draft aab:/absolute/path/app-release.aab
bundle exec fastlane android play_internal aab:/absolute/path/app-release.aab
bundle exec fastlane android play_promote_production from:internal rollout:0.1
```

### One-off supply commands

Use these when adding a Fastfile is overkill:

```bash
# Validate only; should not publish changes
bundle exec fastlane supply \
  --json_key "$GOOGLE_PLAY_JSON_KEY_FILE" \
  --package_name "$ANDROID_PACKAGE_NAME" \
  --aab /absolute/path/app-release.aab \
  --track internal \
  --release_status draft \
  --validate_only true \
  --skip_upload_metadata true \
  --skip_upload_images true \
  --skip_upload_screenshots true

# Upload to internal testing as draft
bundle exec fastlane supply \
  --json_key "$GOOGLE_PLAY_JSON_KEY_FILE" \
  --package_name "$ANDROID_PACKAGE_NAME" \
  --aab /absolute/path/app-release.aab \
  --track internal \
  --release_status draft \
  --skip_upload_metadata true \
  --skip_upload_images true \
  --skip_upload_screenshots true
```

Use `--validate_only true` before any new lane or unfamiliar account. Use `release_status: draft` for the first automated run unless the user explicitly approves a completed rollout.

## Expo EAS Submit

For Expo projects already building with EAS:

```bash
npx eas-cli submit -p android --profile production --latest --non-interactive
```

If no service account is configured, use EAS setup or provide the JSON path:

```bash
npx eas-cli submit -p android \
  --latest \
  --service-account-key-path "$GOOGLE_PLAY_JSON_KEY_FILE"
```

Record in the project runbook whether EAS stores submit credentials remotely or whether CI supplies the JSON key at runtime. Do not upload service account JSON into source control.

## Gradle Play Publisher Option

For native Android projects that prefer Gradle-integrated publishing, use Gradle Play Publisher (GPP):

```kotlin
plugins {
    id("com.github.triplet.play") version "<current-version>"
}

play {
    serviceAccountCredentials.set(file(System.getenv("GOOGLE_PLAY_JSON_KEY_FILE")))
    defaultToAppBundles.set(true)
    track.set("internal")
    releaseStatus.set(com.github.triplet.gradle.androidpublisher.ReleaseStatus.DRAFT)
}
```

Typical commands:

```bash
./gradlew publishBundle --validate-only
./gradlew publishBundle
./gradlew promoteArtifact --from-track internal --promote-track production --release-status inProgress --user-fraction .1
```

Confirm exact plugin version and task names from the repo's Gradle setup before committing changes.

## Metadata Management

fastlane `supply init` can fetch current metadata into `fastlane/metadata/android`. Use it only after access validates and the app exists:

```bash
bundle exec fastlane supply init \
  --json_key "$GOOGLE_PLAY_JSON_KEY_FILE" \
  --package_name "$ANDROID_PACKAGE_NAME"
```

Rules:

- Store metadata text/assets in git only if the team wants listing changes reviewed like code.
- Do not overwrite Play listing copy accidentally. For binary-only release lanes, set `skip_upload_metadata`, `skip_upload_images`, and `skip_upload_screenshots` to `true`.
- Coordinate listing changes with `marketer` and policy/product claims with `product-manager`.

## CI Secret Pattern

For GitHub Actions, store the whole JSON as a secret named `GOOGLE_PLAY_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_JSON`, then materialize it into a temp file:

```yaml
- name: Write Google Play service account
  run: |
    mkdir -p "$RUNNER_TEMP/google-play"
    printf '%s' '${{ secrets.GOOGLE_PLAY_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_JSON }}' > "$RUNNER_TEMP/google-play/service-account.json"
    chmod 600 "$RUNNER_TEMP/google-play/service-account.json"
    echo "GOOGLE_PLAY_JSON_KEY_FILE=$RUNNER_TEMP/google-play/service-account.json" >> "$GITHUB_ENV"
    echo "ANDROID_PACKAGE_NAME=app.example.app" >> "$GITHUB_ENV"

- name: Validate Play access
  run: bundle exec fastlane android play_validate

- name: Upload internal draft
  run: bundle exec fastlane android play_internal_draft aab:path/to/app-release.aab
```

Never print the JSON. Mask any derived values if needed. Clean up temp files at job end if the runner is not ephemeral.

## Publishing Report

After any CLI operation, write/update:

- `.projects/<project>/runbooks/google-play-cli.md`
- `.projects/<project>/release/google-play-publishing-log.md`

Report shape:

```text
Google Play CLI report — <project> — <date/time + timezone>
- Tool: <fastlane supply | EAS Submit | Gradle Play Publisher | API script>
- Package ID:
- Developer account / Play app:
- Service account identity: <email only, no private key>
- Secret location: <local path or CI secret name, no value>
- Track/action:
- Artifact/versionCode:
- Command run:
- validate_only/draft/completed/staged rollout:
- Result/status:
- Play Console URL:
- Follow-ups:
```

## Troubleshooting

- **`Google Api Error: Invalid request - Only releases with status draft may be created on draft app`**: the app is still draft/new; upload as `release_status: draft`, complete required Play setup, then publish/roll out through approved flow.
- **Permission denied / caller does not have permission**: invite the service account in Play Console Users and permissions and grant app-level release permissions for the needed track.
- **Package not found**: wrong `ANDROID_PACKAGE_NAME` or app record/package does not exist in Play Console.
- **Version code already used**: increment `versionCode` and rebuild the AAB.
- **Metadata overwritten unexpectedly**: use `skip_upload_metadata/images/screenshots` for binary-only lanes; review metadata diffs before upload.
- **`supply init` fails before first upload**: create the app and, if needed, perform the first minimal upload through Play Console UI, then switch to CLI automation.
- **JSON key exposed**: revoke/delete the service account key in Google Cloud, remove it from logs/history/secrets, create a new key, and rotate CI/local references.

## Verification Checklist

- [ ] Play app exists for the intended package ID.
- [ ] Google Play Developer API access is enabled/linked.
- [ ] Service account JSON is stored outside git or in CI secrets only.
- [ ] Service account is invited to Play Console with minimum required app permissions.
- [ ] `validate_play_store_json_key` or equivalent read-only validation passes.
- [ ] Package ID and versionCode match the release artifact.
- [ ] First risky run uses `validate_only` or `release_status: draft` unless explicitly approved.
- [ ] Binary-only lanes skip metadata/images/screenshots unless listing changes are intended.
- [ ] CLI result is verified in Play Console or through a follow-up API read.
- [ ] Publishing report/runbook records tool, command, track, artifact, secret location, and current status.
